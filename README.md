# Budget Management Application Documentation

## Overview
This is a simple budget management application written in Python. The application allows users to keep track of their expenses, calculate the total expenses, and determine the remaining budget. Users can add new expenses, view budget details, and save/load budget data to/from a JSON file.

## Features
- **Add Expenses:** Add an expense with a description and an amount.
- **Calculate Total Expenses:** Calculate the total expenses from a list of expense entries.
- **Determine Balance:** Calculate the remaining budget after subtracting total expenses from the initial budget.
- **Show Budget Details:** Display the initial budget, list of expenses, total expenses, and remaining budget.
- **Save Budget Details:** Save the initial budget and list of expenses to a JSON file.
- **Load Budget Details:** Load the initial budget and list of expenses from a JSON file.

## Functions
### `add_expense(expenses, description, amount)`
Adds a new expense to the `expenses` list.

- **Parameters:**
  - `expenses` (list): A list of expense dictionaries.
  - `description` (str): The description of the expense.
  - `amount` (float): The amount of the expense.

- **Returns:** None

### `get_total_expenses(expenses)`
Calculates the total of all expenses in the given list.

- **Parameters:**
  - `expenses` (list): A list of expense dictionaries.

- **Returns:** (float) The total amount of all expenses.

### `get_balance(budget, expenses)`
Calculates the remaining budget after subtracting the total expenses from the given budget.

- **Parameters:**
  - `budget` (float): The initial budget.
  - `expenses` (list): A list of expense dictionaries.

- **Returns:** (float) The remaining budget.

### `show_budget_details(budget, expenses)`
Displays the initial budget, a list of expenses, the total expenses, and the remaining budget.

- **Parameters:**
  - `budget` (float): The initial budget.
  - `expenses` (list): A list of expense dictionaries.

- **Returns:** None

### `load_budget_data(filepath)`
Loads budget data from a JSON file.

- **Parameters:**
  - `filepath` (str): The path to the JSON file.

- **Returns:** (tuple) A tuple containing the initial budget and the list of expenses. If the file is not found or cannot be read, returns `(0, [])`.

### `save_budget_details(filepath, initial_budget, expenses)`
Saves budget data to a JSON file.

- **Parameters:**
  - `filepath` (str): The path to the JSON file.
  - `initial_budget` (float): The initial budget.
  - `expenses` (list): A list of expense dictionaries.

- **Returns:** None

## Main Function
### `main()`
The main function acts as an entry point to the budget application. It presents a menu to the user, allowing them to add expenses, view budget details, and exit the application. Upon exiting, the budget data is saved to a JSON file.

- **Operations:**
  - Loads budget data from a specified JSON file.
  - Prompts the user to enter an initial budget if it does not already exist.
  - Continuously presents a menu for the user to choose an action (add expense, view budget details, exit).
  - Saves the budget data to the JSON file upon exit.

- **User Input:**
  - Expense description and amount.
  - Menu choices (1 to add an expense, 2 to view budget details, 3 to exit).

- **Returns:** None

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Save the code to a Python file, for example, `budget_app.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
4. Run the code using `python budget_app.py`.
5. Follow the prompts to add expenses, view budget details, or exit the application. If you exit, budget data is saved to `budget_data.json`.

## Known Limitations
- No advanced error handling for invalid inputs.
- No user authentication.
- No data encryption.
- Simple expense data structure; does not track dates or categories.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more comprehensive error handling.
- Add support for different budget categories.
- Track expense dates.
- Introduce user authentication and data encryption for security.

With this documentation, you should have a comprehensive understanding of the budget application, its functions, and how to use it.
